# Black Scholes App
This is just a simple web app that I created that allows users to input data and see the outputted black-scholes model on the right for varying levels of stock volatility. The backent was 
created using Python, specifically by using FastAPI to integrate it with the frontend components. The frontend was developed utilizing JavaScript and libraries like React as well as basic
HTML and CSS.

## Steps for Running Locally:
* Run the command "uvicorn main:app --reload" from the backend folder
* Run the command "npm start" from the frontend folder
